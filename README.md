ansible-role-digital-ocean
==========================

An Ansible role, available via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com), that provisions a Digital Ocean droplet.

This role works with [our repo to create a vagrant virtualbox vm](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-roles-vagrant), but is easily modifed to work with actual ubuntu boxes.

You'll probably want to amend / override:

* `defaults/main.yml`

Installation
------------

Preusming a `requirements.yml` as follows:

    # Install a role from GitHub
    - name: ansible-role-common
    src: https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-common

We can install the role locally, using a `requirements.yml` file:

    # Install a role from GitHub
    - name: ansible-role-common
    src: https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-common
    path: roles/

Install the role:

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p ./roles


Requirements
------------

You may already have:

* Created a vagrant VirtualBox virtual machine using [ansible-roles-vagrant](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-users)
* Provisioned the virtual machine with users using [ansible-role-users](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-users)
